Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this error.

Verify that the host IP address is I am using is correct.
Verify that my network supports connectivity over the SSH port being used. Some public networks may block port 22 or custom SSH ports. 
for example, testing other hosts using the same port with a known working SSH server. This can help to determine if the issue isn’t specific to just a particular server.
Verify the  firewall rules. Check that they’re not set to a default policy of DROP and the port is not added to allow connections.
